    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>package frozen puff pastry sheets thawed</li>
        <li>4 oz container garlic and spice flavored Alouette cheese</li>
        <li>6 skinned and boned chiecken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>garnish kale leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Unfold pastry sheets, and roll each sheet into a 14- x 12-
            inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Cut one sheet 
            into four 7- x 6-inch rectangles; cut second sheet into two 
            7- x 6-inch rectangles and one 12- x 6-inch rectangle. 
            Set large rectangle aside. Shape each small rectangle into 
            an oval by trimming off corners. Spread pastry ovals evenly 
            with cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken breast halves with salt and pepper, and 
            place one in center of each pastry oval. Lightly moisten 
            pastry edges with water. Fold ends over chicken; fold sides 
            over, and press to seal. Place each bundle, seam side down, 
            on a lightly greased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cut remaining large pastry rectangle into 12- x 1/4-inch 
            strips. Braid 2 strips together, and place crosswise over 
            chicken bundles, trimming and reserving excess braid; braid 
            two additional strips, and place lengthwise over bundle, 
            trimming and tucking ends under. Repeat procedure with 
            remaining strips. Cover and refrigerate up to 2 hours, if 
            desired.</li>
        <li>Combine egg and 1 tablespoon water; brush over pastry bundles.
             Bake at 400 on lower oven rack 25 minutes or until bundles 
             are golden brown. Garnish, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
